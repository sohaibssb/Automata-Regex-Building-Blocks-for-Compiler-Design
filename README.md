# Building Blocks for Compiler Design

This repository provides essential tools for building a compiler using automata and regular expressions. It includes Python scripts to:

Convert NFA to DFA: Efficiently transform a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using NFAtoDFA.py.
Minimize DFA: Optimize the DFA states to minimize redundant paths and improve performance with MinimizeDFA.py.
Test DFAs: Verify the correctness and performance of DFA implementations using TestDFAM.py.
Regex to DFA Conversion: Convert regular expressions into corresponding DFA structures via regtodfa.py.
The repository also contains example JSON files illustrating the conversion processes for NFA, DFA, and minimized DFA, serving as test inputs and reference outputs.
