Lab#1: 
Folder_Name: (RegexToNFA_ToDFA_ToDFAM)

Program that takes an arbitrary regular expression as input and executes the following transformations:
1) Based on a regular expression, it builds an NFA.
2) Based on the NFA, constructs an equivalent DFA.
3) Based on the DFA, it constructs an equivalent FA that has the least possible number of states.
By using the algorithm: Minimization_DFA,_Hopcroft_algorithm.
4) Models the minimum CA for the input string from the terminals of the original grammar.

Lab#2: 
Folder_Name: (Left_Recursion_CSG)

Program that removes left recursion and unreachable symbols from a given context-sensitive grammar G = (N, Î£, P, S)
